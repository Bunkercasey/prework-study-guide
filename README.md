# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a webpage that has the Prework notes for bootcamp students. I was motivated to make this so I could have my notes easily accessible. I built this project for an easy way to look at notes, and to be able to learn the basics of coding a webpage. It provides an easy to access set of notes. I learned the basics of coding a webpage including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
